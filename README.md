in the <code>&#095;binary&#095;</code> you'll find <code>PIT_Magic_v1.3.10_Release.zip</code>, as downloaded from somewhere.

<hr/>

Both C# and VB.Net sources should be the same,
the source-code, was probably written in VB.Net .

<hr/>

for your safety, please avoid running/using the zip/exe/source,
<strong>it is an unofficial source-code for PIT-Magic,<br/>reversed-engineered from for education-purposes only.</strong>
